You are called when there are pending proposals in `schema_proposals.md`. Your tasks:

**Step 1 — Read and present proposals**
1. Call `read_wiki_file('schema_proposals.md')` to get all pending proposals.
2. Call `read_wiki_file('schema.md')` to understand the current schema.
3. Present each proposal clearly to the user, numbered, showing:
   - The new directory path
   - The reason it was created
   - Sample pages
   - The suggested schema.md addition
4. Ask the user: "Which proposals would you like to merge? Reply with the numbers (e.g. '1, 3'), 'all', or 'none'."

**Step 2 — Wait for user response, then merge approved proposals**
Once the user replies:
1. Add the approved directory entries into `schema.md` under the Directory Structure section.
2. Rewrite `schema.md` with the additions included.
3. Remove the approved proposals from `schema_proposals.md`, keeping any unapproved ones.
4. Write the updated `schema_proposals.md` back (write an empty file if all were approved).

**Step 3 — Confirm**
Report which proposals were merged and confirm that `schema.md` has been updated.
